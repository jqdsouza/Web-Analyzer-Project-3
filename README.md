# Web-Analyzer-Project-3
All three projects are themed around the topic of web server analysis. They are designed to culminate in a limited simulation and assessment of a web server if all project tasks are properly completed. In Project 1, we computed some statistics on the resources that are served. In Project 2, we incorporated client-requests to an extent. In this Project, we incorporate client-requests with priorities, and a light version of Discrete Event Simulations.
